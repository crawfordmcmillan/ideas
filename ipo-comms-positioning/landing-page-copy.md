# IPO Communications - Landing Page Copy

**Positioning Angle:** The Quiet Window

The 6-12 months before you file is when your narrative gets set in stone. Most companies waste this window. We own it.

## Hero Section

**Headline:**
By the time you file your S-1, your narrative is already written.
The question is: by whom?

**Subhead:**
The 6-12 months before you go public is when valuations get made or left on the table. Most companies waste this window. We own it.

## The Problem

**Your IPO has a narrative problem you don't know about yet.**

Right now, somewhere in the market, investors are forming opinions about your company. Analysts are building mental models. Journalists are deciding if you're a story worth covering.

This is happening whether you're ready or not.

The window between "we're thinking about going public" and "we just filed" is when your story gets locked. Not the roadshow. Not the pricing call. The months before anyone knows you're coming.

Most companies spend this time on lawyers and bankers. They assume the story will come together later. It doesn't.

By the time they're on the roadshow, the narrative is already baked. The analyst consensus is already forming. The first-day pop (or drop) is already in motion.

**The quiet period isn't when your story starts. It's when it gets locked.**

---

## The Gap

**Here's what happens when companies wait:**

They file. The S-1 tells investors what they do.

But it doesn't tell them what they're worth.

That story lives in the coverage analysts read before the roadshow. In the executive profiles journalists have already written. In the digital footprint that shapes first impressions.

Companies that nail the pre-filing window don't just get better coverage. They get better valuations. The narrative precedes the numbers. The story shapes the multiple.

We've seen the difference. Our most recent client achieved a valuation that surprised even their bankers. Not because the numbers changed. Because the story was already in place when the numbers showed up.

## What We Do

**We run the 12 months before your S-1 like a campaign.**

Not a PR campaign. A narrative campaign across every surface that touches your valuation.

**Media relations.** The journalists who move your stock price are in a 10-block radius. We know them. When they write about your sector, your executives are the ones they call.

**Digital footprint.** Your online presence is your pre-roadshow roadshow. We make sure every search, every profile, every mention tells the same story.

**Influencer engagement.** Industry voices shape analyst opinion. We put your leadership in the conversations that matter before they matter.

**Executive positioning.** Investors bet on jockeys, not horses. We position your leadership team as the reason to believe.

Four disciplines. One integrated story. One team.

---

## Why This Works

**Large agencies silo these functions.**

Media team files the press releases. Digital team runs the LinkedIn. IR team preps the roadshow deck. Executive coach works with the CEO.

By the time your story reaches the market, it's four different stories. The S-1 says one thing. The CEO profile says another. The digital footprint contradicts both.

Analysts notice. Investors notice. Your valuation reflects the confusion.

We run all four as one campaign because that's how the market receives you: as one company with one story. The narrative has to be consistent before it can be compelling.

---

## Who This Is For

**Companies 12-18 months from filing who understand that the quiet window is the highest-leverage period for valuation.**

You're a good fit if:
- You're targeting a New York listing
- Your leadership team is a genuine asset, not a liability
- You believe narrative shapes valuation, not just numbers
- You want one team owning the full story, not four vendors coordinating poorly

You're not a fit if:
- You're 3 months from filing (too late for this approach)
- You want traditional PR metrics (impressions, clips) instead of valuation outcomes
- You're optimizing for coverage volume, not narrative quality

---

## The Outcome

**Your S-1 lands in a market that already knows your story.**

Analysts have seen your executives quoted as experts. Journalists have already written the profiles. Your digital presence reflects the company you're about to become, not the one you used to be.

The roadshow isn't where you introduce yourself. It's where you confirm what people already believe.

That's when valuations exceed expectations.
